<h3>About Me<small> 4/20/1998</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://github.com/Melodrama420/Melodrama.github.io/blob/master/IMG_20191017_134136.jpg?raw=true">
<p>I’m a 21-year-old college student with 5 years of experience in the customer service industry. I was born and raised in Mandeville, Louisiana until I moved out to Baton Rouge for college in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy listening to and creating music, enjoying the outdoors, solving puzzles (crossword, sudoku, jigsaw, etc.), and playing video games. I’ve enjoyed creating things since I was a child so art came to me like second nature. I played clarinet in middle school and was always engaged during art class. My family and I regularly go on vacations to various national parks around the country. I enjoy hiking and trail riding because being in nature is a great way to get away from the stresses of society. I play video games and solve puzzles to sharpen my reflexes and problem-solving abilities. Through my years of experience, my decision-making skills have only gotten quicker and smarter.</p>

<h3>My Time at LSU <small>  8/2016-12/2020</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://github.com/Melodrama420/Melodrama.github.io/blob/master/LSU.jpg?raw=true">
<p>When I first started at LSU, I was majoring in Mechanical Engineering. It wasn’t until two years later that I realized my talents were better utilized at the E.J. Ourso College of Business. In the second half of my professional career, I want to be the owner of my own business. Therefore, I decided to major in General Business; I can get a broad understanding of the many areas of business and learn specifics through my experience “in the field.” I minored in Information Technology Management (ITM) because I wanted to get a better understanding of the evolving IT and IS in the world today. I'm fascinated with data management and, more specifically, data security; I’ve been playing around with computers since I was a teenager and the issue has only become more prevalent as I’ve grown up. I’ve learned Python (Beginning Programming) and MySQL/DBMS (Database Processing for Management) in my previous semester, and I'm currently getting my AWS certification through my Enterprise Architecture class. I'm also taking a course regarding SCRUM, but due to COVID-19, the ISDS department isn't funding the SCRUM master certification for ISDS minors.</p>

<h3>Working at Rouse's Supermarket <small>  3/2015-7/2016</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://github.com/Melodrama420/Melodrama.github.io/blob/master/Rouses.png?raw=true">
<p>I started at Rouse’s as a cashier on the front end. It didn’t take long for me to get good at ringing up customers as quickly as possible. In under two months, I had one of the highest RPMs (rings per minute) of all the cashiers at the store. I’d memorized most of the produce codes and the layout of the store. The labor wasn’t the only part of the job, though; I also had to conversate with customers during the process, help them find items, and/or give them recommendations about what to buy. As soon as I turned 18, I was promoted to the Customer Service desk and Cash Office. I had the added responsibilities of taking phone calls, managing cashier/bagger breaks and duties, performing advanced operations on the POS system (i.e. returns, discounts, specialty items), opening/closing out tills, and balancing the “bank” at the end of my shift. While I may not have been in the position for long (5 months), it was the first time I was able to develop my leadership abilities.</p>

<h3>Working at Raising Cane's <small>  2/2017-Current</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://github.com/Melodrama420/Melodrama.github.io/blob/master/Canes.jpg?raw=true">
<p>The Raising Cane’s I work at (C1 on LSU campus) is a fast-paced and high stress environment that requires every employee to communicate well with one another. There are a lot of customers that come in daily, and even more so when LSU football has a home game. The only aspect of this job that was new to me when I started was the food service. Once I was able to get that down, I quickly became a Certified Trainer. This requires you to be cross-trained to work in the kitchen or at the counter, and to be good enough at both to teach somebody how to do it. I was able to fine-tune my leadership abilities as a trainer since I was a role model for all new hires (trainee or not). Since it’s the food industry, people are extremely picky about how their food comes out; if it’s not perfect, it’s most likely going to be sent back or a customer may leave a bad survey. This meant order accuracy had to be high and wait times had to be low or there’d be a lot of angry customers to deal with. When events like this do happen, I’m always able to assure the customer leaves satisfied. There are biannual evaluations to let you know if you’re improving or not, and each time including the first I’ve been in the highest category (no improvement needed).</p>
